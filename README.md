# Interactive-Contact-Us-Section
I created an interactive contact us section. The section contains a puzzle created with HTML5, Css3 and JS.

## How the code works?
The code is very simple:
- ***Html*** is used to create the webpage and contain the information. There's two divs: The "*fake container*" and the "*real container*". The first one is the fake container and which you need to solve the puzzle to get to the real container.
- ***Css*** is used to design html elements. There is the main *style.css* file which is used to design all the general elements in the *index.html* and there are other css files for the specific element like the *eyes*, *switch* and *contact*.
- ***JS*** is used to add the events to our dom and also set the clip-path when the user clicks on the switch to active the puzzle. The code is very simple in the JS folder, you just need to read it carefully.

## The puzzle
If you get stuck in the puzzle and you couldn't see the real contact-us form, just **Double-Click** on the black eye in the center screen, then click on the switch below it, or just set the "fake container" display to *none* or visibility to *hidden*.
